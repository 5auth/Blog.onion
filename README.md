# Blog.onion

Host your own hidden-service darknet blog on an Android device!

- The easiest way to host your own anonymous hidden-service darknet blog!
- Just install the Blog.onion Android app and start blogging.
- Start your own blog with just a single tap. No signup required.
- Your blog will be hosted as a hidden service behind the Tor anonymity network to protect your identity and IP address. 
- And since your blog is hosted directly on your device (not on anyone else's server), no one can just delete your blog if they don't like what you say.
